#### References

Currently, as far as I know, ov8856 is the only upstream driver that supports both DT and ACPI at the same time.
ACPI support is the first, then later added DT support by commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0c2c7a1e0d69221b9d489bfd8cf53262d6f82446 ("media: ov8856: Add devicetree support").

Original driver files are from rockchip-linux/kernel (driver for v4.4 but not for atomisp):
